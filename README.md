# Particle pusher in strongly magnetized fields

Repo contains code to simulate the motion of a 'loop' of charged particles in a strongly magnetized, inhomogeneous field ($ |B| = O(\epsilon^{-1})$). As the number of particles grows and $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$, we get useful information about the dynamical system introduced in [this paper](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jmp/article/61/1/012703/465539/Guiding-center-dynamics-as-motion-on-a-formal-slow).
